# Quant basics
A notebook with a introductory study on quantitative finance.
- Loading assets historic prices
- Risc and returns (volatility)
- Dealing with portfolios
- Time series forecasting

The code presented here is mine, but most of the markdown cells are not. Credits on the markdown and notebook structure to the Grupo Turing.

I usually write code in english. Since this notebook structure was already provided to me in portuguese, it has a mixed language (portuguese/english).

In order to fully run this notebook you are supposed to have the correct data placed on the data folder. I will be working on uploading that latter.
